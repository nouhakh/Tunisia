  <p>One of the most popular tourist destinations in North Africa, Tunisia offers an incredibly diverse range of experiences. Along the Mediterranean coast, resort towns like Hammamet provide an abundance of sun and sea; while the southern Sahara is populated by dramatic desert landscapes, fascinating Berber villages and abandoned Star Wars sets. Tunisia's status during Roman times is evident in the well-preserved ruins at El Jem and Carthage, while Tunis offers all the cultural and culinary opportunities you'd expect from a major capital.</p>
  <h3>Location:</h3>
  <p>Tunisia is located in North Africa on the Mediterranean coast. It is bordered by Algeria to the west and Libya to the southeast.</p>
  <h3>Geography:</h3>
  <p>With a total land mass of 59,984 square miles/155,360 square kilometers, Tunisia is slightly larger than the state of Georgia. It is mountainous in the north and extends into the Sahara Desert in the south.</p>
  <h3>Capital city:</h3>
  <p>The capital of Tunisia is Tunis, located in the far north of the country.</p>
  <h3>Population:</h3>
  <p>According to a CIA World Factbook estimate, Tunisia's population stood at just over 11.4 million people in July 2017</p>
  <h3>Language:</h3>
  <p>The official language of Tunisia is Arabic. French acts as a language of commerce and is spoken by around two thirds of the population, while Berber is the principal language of the south.</p>
  <h3>Climate: </h3>
  <p>Northern Tunisia has a Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers and mild, rainy winters. The further south you go, the climate gets more arid; and in the southern desert, it is hot, dry and sunny all year round. Rainfall is almost non-existent, though winter nights in the desert can get chilly.</p>
  <h3>When to go:</h3>
  <p>Tunisia is a year-round destination, but if you're heading to the north, the best weather occurs between May and October. In the Sahara, summers are typically scorching and those with a low tolerance for extreme heat may prefer to travel during the winter (November to February).</p>
